# Weather App
 
 
I initially started by making a moodboard on pinterest to see what app designs caught my eye. I found to like the apps that took an illustrative approach with more vibrant colours. I was able to see what is currently out there and what is maybe missing in the market at the moment.

I then created a style guide for my project which set me my basic visuals to work from e.g colours, logo etc.

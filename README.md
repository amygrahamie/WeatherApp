# Weather App IXD303
 

* [Moodboard](https://uk.pinterest.com/grahamie/weather-app/)

I initially started by making a moodboard on pinterest to see what app designs caught my eye. I found to like the apps that took an illustrative approach with more vibrant colours. I was able to see what is currently out there and what is maybe missing in the market at the moment.
 
 * [Style Guide](https://amygrahamie.github.io/WeatherApp/styleguide.html)

I then created a style guide for my project which set me my basic visuals to work from e.g colours, logo etc.

* [Illustrations](https://amygrahamie.github.io/WeatherApp/illustrations.html)

I have displayed some of the illustrations I did for the app. I found it hard to keep my style consistent for all of the screens but I hope in the end I have sewn in enough consistencies of my style throughout to bring it all together.

I also felt these illustrations could be versatile and used in other forms.

Finally I have constructed a site to showcase how my designs may be used. Also including a prototype of the site in action.
